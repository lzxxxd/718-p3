# Climate Change in China: A Decade of Warming? (2011–2020)

## Project Overview

This project is part of the AAE 718 course at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. It examines whether China's surface temperatures have shown a significant warming trend over the period from 2011 to 2020, using data derived from NOAA's ISD-Lite (Integrated Surface Dataset – Lite).

The choice of China is not incidental. As one of the largest nations both in territory and emissions, it offers a vast and diverse climate space—ranging from the frozen plateaus of Tibet to the humid subtropics of Guangdong. This diversity enables not only national-level observation but also regional pattern analysis in the future.

The aim is not to forecast, but to **document**, to **observe**, and to **interpret**.

## Research Question

> Has China experienced a statistically observable warming trend in national average surface temperature during the 2011–2020 decade?

This question is addressed through the aggregation of daily weather station observations into annual national means, followed by trend visualization and interpretation.


## Data Source

- **Source**: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
- **Dataset**: Integrated Surface Dataset - Lite (ISD-Lite)
- **Link**: [NOAA ISD-Lite Archive](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-summary-of-the-day/archive/)
- **Time Span**: 2011–2020
- **Geographic Scope**: Mainland China stations only

Due to GitHub file size limits, the raw data files are not included in this repository.  
They can be accessed and downloaded from the above NOAA archive.

## How to Run

All scripts are written in Python 3 using the following packages:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

To reproduce the results:
1. Download ISD-Lite data for China (2011–2020)
2. Place `.txt` or extracted station files in the `/data` directory
3. Run the provided notebook or script (coming soon)
